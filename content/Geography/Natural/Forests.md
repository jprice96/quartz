title: "Forests"

Many different regions of dense vegetation exist across the continent. Here are the larger key groups.
## Black Forest
To the south of [Agercort](Geography/Agercort.md) lies the Black Forest, a seemingly endless stretch of dense pine trees. Deep within it is the famous [College of Night](Culture/Factions/College%20of%20Night.md). Travel by foot is dangerous, as the forests are supposedly full of all manner of beasts and dark fae.
## Grey Forest
On the northern borders of [Cruworia](Geography/Cruworia.md) lies the Grey Forest, a large area heavily covered by a mixture of ash trees and dense ground shrubbery. It produces a large amount of the lumber used by both Cruworia and the [Weald](Geography/Weald/Weald.md).
## Forest of Needles
On the south-east border of [Vurnam](Geography/Vurnam.md) lies a particularly large area covered in sparse birch forest. The largest forested region at all that far north of the [[Geography/Natural/Waterways#Reden|Reden]], its name comes from the many varieties of thorny and prickly undergrowth that seem to thrive in the dry environment.
