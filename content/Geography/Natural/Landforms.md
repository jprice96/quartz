### Bidohrung Canyons
In the north-eastern deserts, between the [[Geography/Natural/Landforms#Oranrier Canyon|Oranrier Canyon]] and the [[Geography/Natural/Landforms#Krystalglass Fields|Krystalglass Fields]], lies a vast labyrinth of deep canyons, overlooked by a great peak. Many have been lost wandering the crevasses of Bidohrung, and there are many stories of the unnatural creatures that lurk within. Few willingly go there, but those that do are often lured by nonsensical myths of lost treasures or hidden magics that are hidden amongst the stones.
### Cliffs of Shrieking Clouds
Marking the eastern fronts of the Vurnamese desert, a great line of cliffs are buffetted by the winds and clouds that come from the ocean further east, blocking most from travelling much further. It is said that when standing along their heights, the sound of the wind crashing against the rock face will whistle and shriek like the wind is shrieking.
### Krystalglass Fields
On the western edges of the Vurnamese desert, within the territories of the [[Culture/List of Factions#Nekrifos Coven|Nekrifos Coven]], lies a great stretch of desert seemingly made of pure white sand. Some describes unusual patterns left in the sand, while others even describe flowers and plants made from the same white substance. It is known that the sand has an effect on those who spend too long there and so many tales that have come from those foolish enough to wander into the area are dismissed as mirage or madness.
### Mount Huagoyen
At the origins of the [[Geography/Natural/Waterways#Widow River|Widow River]] stands a great mountain made of dark black rock. Its unusual colour has led many locals to attribute mystical properties to the location, and so most are warned from attempting to scale the mountain. Legends speak of a palace carved into the mountain's peak from which monsters emerge to roam the mountain looking for foolish travellers.
### Mount Zirfeifen
Where the [[Geography/Natural/Waterways#Reden|Reden]] and the [[Geography/Natural/Waterways#Kulte|Kulte]] fork, they do so around Mount Zirfeifen (zur-fey-fen) which both shadows and shields the town of [[Geography/Vurnam#Flucha|Flucha]]. Said to be the home of [[Mythos/The Mortal Gods/Lingzul#Skanareng, Beast of Metal|Skanareng]], one of the Five Beasts of [[Mythos/The Mortal Gods/Lingzul|Lingzul]], there are those in town who offer regular worship and offerings to the great serpent in order to appease it.
### Oranrier Canyon
Part of the ranges that separate desert from savannah, the Oranrier Canyon features a great crevasse that extends down below the surface, revealing flecks of copper and other minerals. Some scale down the canyon to extract such minerals, but it is a dangerous feat to partake in. The canyon eventually ends by opening up into the savannah at [[Geography/Vurnam/Tribes/Vongtu#Scorpion Plateau|Scorpion Plateau]].
### Steppes of Sunlight
A region of moors and cliffs separating the desert highlands from the savannah north of [[Geography/Vurnam/Major Cities/Gerting|Gerting]].
### Sylvar Cascades
A spread out collection of various waterfalls and pools that eventually merge to become the [[Geography/Natural/Waterways#Flewgell River|Flewgell River]]. The constant upheaval of water spray results in a particularly lush and humid region surrounding it.
