title: "Rivers"
---
The main rivers of the continent are the Reden, the Ilma, and the Kulte. Many smaller rivers, lakes, and springs also dot the continent.
## Reden
The Reden river is the longest in the continent, beginning in the high mountains near [[Geography/Mallerand#Topmundi|Topmundi]] and running all the way east through the [[Geography/Weald/Weald|Weald]] to the ocean at [[Geography/Port Manteaux|Port Manteaux]]. Both the [[Geography/Natural/Waterways#Ilma|Ilma]] and [[Geography/Natural/Waterways#Kulte|Kulte]] branch off the Reden.
## Ilma
Branching off from the [[Geography/Natural/Waterways#Reden|Reden]] to head south into [[Geography/Cruworia|Cruworia]], where it eventually ends at the [[Geography/Natural/Waterways#Kaskate Falls|Kaskate Falls]]. Where it branches off sits the town of [[Geography/Weald/Weald#Gemend|Gemend]].
## Kulte
Branching off from the [[Geography/Natural/Waterways#Reden|Reden]] just beyond the borders of [[Geography/Mallerand|Mallerand]], the Kulte river extends all the way from [[Geography/Vurnam#Flucha|Flucha]] to [[Geography/Vurnam#Rotewan|Rotewan]]. It is a major channel of movement across [[Geography/Vurnam|Vurnam]], as well as a water source for much of the region.

## **Cruworia**

### Kaskate Falls
The end of the [[Geography/Natural/Waterways#Ilma|Ilma river]], the falls are a great chasm into which the water ceaselessly drains in a great crashing white wonder. The nearby town of [[Geography/Cruworia#Semabar|Semabar]] marks the final point on the Ilma before one has gone too far and any boats will be pulled by the currents into the abyss. Over history, there have been a few brave (or foolhardy) adventurers willing to brave the Falls in order to see what may lie beyond the great drop, but such accounts cannot be corroborated and vary wildly.

## **Mallerand**


## **Vurnam**

### Arraset River
A small river along the western border of Vurnam, collecting run off from the northern foothills into the Reden before the Kulte branches off.
### Danjei Lake
An oxbow lake off of [[Geography/Natural/Waterways#Sweetwater River|Sweetwater River]], it is known for producing [[Geography/Vurnam/Tribes/Gu'shoter#Danjei|firefruit]], a variant of [[Culture/Crops and Agriculture#Zarfruit|zarfruit]].
### Flewgell River
A river in the southwest of Vurnam, beginning in the [[Geography/Natural/Landforms#Sylvar Cascades|Sylvar Cascades]] and ending in joining the Kulte river.
### Greenwater Shallows
A collection of shallow water pools produced in the upper regions of the [[Geography/Natural/Waterways#Oransand River|Oransand River]], resulting from various ground waters and run-off collecting in the local water basin before flowing outwards.
### Greyreed Delta
The delta region of the [[Geography/Natural/Waterways#Ming River|Ming River]], it is named after the prolific presence of a local bulrush reed that produces large dull grey spikes.
### Ming River
The general name given to the collection of rivers that spread from the [[Geography/Natural/Landforms#Cliffs of Shrieking Clouds|Cliffs of Shrieking Clouds]] eastwards to the ocean.
### Mitoro River
Beginning in the [[Geography/Natural/Forests#Forest of Needles|Forest of Needles]], the Mitoro River curves into southern Vurnam until it meets the Kulte.
### Oransand River
Drawing waters from up as far as the [[Geography/Natural/Landforms#Oranrier Canyon|Oranrier Canyon]], the Oransand River extends down to the Kulte. Its name is likely a result of the dull orange colour present at times along the river bed resulting from trace amounts of copper in the sand.
### Lake Sang
A large natural spring in northern [[Geography/Vurnam|Vurnam]] which serves as the main water supply of [[Geography/Vurnam#Baisen|Baisen]]. It wells up from deep within the ground and is home to a number of fish and plants not seen else where on the continent. Some say that the Sang is the tears of the earth, still mourning the death of [[Mythos/The Mortal Gods/Drytog|Drytog]].
### Shu'Ang Lakes
An oxbow lake off of [[Geography/Natural/Waterways#Stillwater River|Stillwater River]] which has grown in response to a lightly forested region now growing around it.
### Shutai Waterfields
A collection of seasonal water pools that form in the lowlands coming off the passageway between the [[Geography/Natural/Landforms#Oranrier Canyon|Oranrier Canyon]] and the [[Geography/Natural/Landforms#Steppes of Sunlight|Steppes of Sunlight]]. These temporary watering holes provide water to many migratory herds during the summer months.
### Stillwater River
A small river south of [[Geography/Vurnam/Major Cities/Baisen|Baisen]] that heads into the Kulte.
### Sweetwater River
A river that forms from the waters collected in a forested area around [[Geography/Vurnam/Tribes/Gu'shoter#Zwei Ling Fork|Zwei Ling Fork]], eventually joining the [[Geography/Natural/Waterways#Oransand River|Oransand River]] before it meets the Kulte.
### Widow River
Winding from the area surrounding [[Geography/Natural/Landforms#Mount Huagoyen|Mount Huagoyen]], it is known for its incredibly crystal clear water which, in combination with the black minerals near the early parts of it, result in an eerie appearance. It eventually merges with the [[Geography/Natural/Waterways#Mitoro River|Mitoro River]].

## **Weald**

### Koray Caves
A network of coastal caves, many of which are either permanently or tidally submerged, located at the town of [[Geography/Weald/Weald#Selport|Selport]]. Many cave divers gather resources from the caves, such as pearls, corals, shellfish, seaweeds, and many other valuable marine commodities found in abundance within the caves. Attempts to explore the caves are risky, as they appear to go quite deep and are impossible to explore without magical assistance.
### Sullen Swamp
After the [[Geography/Natural/Waterways#Reden|Reden]] branches with the [[Geography/Natural/Waterways#Kulte|Kulte]], many other creeks and such branch off into an area of low elevation at the base of the foothills of [[Geography/Mallerand|Mallerand]]. As a result, the area exists as a large marshy swampland, home to many small [[Culture/Mortal Races/Goblin|goblin]] tribes. Despite its difficult to traverse terrain, many do still eke out a living in the area, either desiring the isolation or seeking out the rare exotic resources that can be acquired deep in the swamps.
### Marekaj Marsh
Where the [[Geography/Natural/Waterways#Reden|Reden]] meets the ocean and breaks apart into dozens of small tributaries, the Marekaj Marsh is home to many goblins and halflings who fish and hunt the mangrove delta. Along the main branch of the river, on one of the few large solid pieces of land along the coast, lies [[Geography/Port Manteaux|Port Manteaux]].
