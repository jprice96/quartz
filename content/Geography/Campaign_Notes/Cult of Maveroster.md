This cult reveres Dyphora, believing that just like Tenesia, Dyphora seeks to transform the world into something better - something more. The cult is mostly superstitious rural folks of the Southern Weald, they are relatively disjointed and unorganised but this is changing under their new leader, a powerful warlock who claims to speak in Dyphora's name. Their plans involve the use of occult bloodstones which use the blood of lured and captured Dandasuka (a lesser form of rakshasa) to transmute creatures into new forms. The source of these "monsters" are experiments using such fiend bloodstones to forcibly transform creatures, and eventually people, into new forms. The ultimate goal of this is for the cultists to become *faceless stalkers*, creatures who can shift their form in order to infiltrate and manipulate society. In this way they hope to bring about long-lasting change.

For many cultists, they are not particularly clear on the end goals of the cult, they are superstitious folk who either want the protections of being a member or who are just fed up with the lack of security in the Weald. Even in the Southern Weald, where resources are plentiful, there are still bandits, monsters, plague, and no greater authorities to help them. The cult offers this, a way for them to help themselves, to improve the way things are done, and offers power to these often powerless peasants.
