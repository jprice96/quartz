Amidst the deserts of northern [[Geography/Vurnam|Vurnam]], within a great crater, lies the city of Baisen. Home to almost 12,500 people, it is the second largest city in the country by far, and has always represented an outlier in Vurnam culture. While there were tribes roaming the desert area prior, most people consider Baisen to have been founded shortly after the [[Mythos/The Mortal Gods/Drytog#Death|death of Drytog]] as it was at this time that the [[Mythos/The Mortal Gods/Drytog#God's Rock|God's Rock]] fell and created what is now [[Geography/Natural/Waterways#Lake Sang|Lake Sang]]. In the almost two centuries before the [[Culture/History/Scarlett War|Scarlett War]] began, Baisen grew rapidly into a metropolis city, supported by farming the now fertile shores of Lake Sang and populated by pilgrims from across the continent come to pay homage to [[Mythos/The Mortal Gods/Drytog|Drytog]].
## Lake Sang
The shores of Lake Sang itself are heavily utilised for growing [[Culture/Crops and Agriculture#Brownbean|brownbeans]] and [[Culture/Crops and Agriculture#Feathercorn|feathercorn]], with the higher slopes used for [[Culture/Crops and Agriculture#Saltberries|saltberry]] orchards. Within the lake are varieties of fish and aquatic flora unique to Baisen, with the water seeming to be a combination of rain collected in the basin of the crater and upwelling groundwater given the local low elevation. Without it, it would be impossible to sustain a population of this size so far from the [[Geography/Natural/Waterways#Kulte|Kulte]].
## God's Rock
The [[Mythos/The Mortal Gods/Drytog#God's Rock|God's Rock]] fell in 2E 101, marking the death of Drytog, and has been a holy site for his clergy ever since. Clerics from across the continent, including most [[Culture/Factions/Whitesun Lodge#Journeymen|Whitesun Lodge journeymen]], make a pilgrimage to the Rock during their lifetime. As a result, a great temple complex has been erected around the monolith, with living quarters for both permanent and visiting residents. Many ceremonies and rituals are held here, and the record halls in Baisen are said to potentially rival even the [[Culture/Factions/College of Night|College of Night]] and the [[Geography/Mallerand/Arx Saxum#Vaults of Sasellum|Vaults of Sasellum]].
