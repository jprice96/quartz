The largest coastal port in [[Geography/Vurnam|Vurnam]] at approximately 3,000 permanent residents, Rotewan is one of the oldest settlements in the whole kingdom. Positioned on the southern shore of the [[Geography/Natural/Waterways#Kulte|Kulte]] where it meets the ocean, all water traffic between Vurnam and the rest of the continental coast comes through there. Unlike many Vurnam settlements, Rotewan features old but sturdy fortifications following centuries of pirate raids during the First Era. Other than working the trade docks, much of the population fish in the bay to supply food for the town.
## Light of Vilakan
The literal highlight of Rotewan, the Light of Vilakan is a great brass brazier housed in a small shrine along the docks. It acts now as a lighthouse for ships at night, but it also has use as a defence against naval attacks - deceiving would be night time attackers into dashing themselves upon the shore. When lit, it burns not red or yellow, but an eerie cyan. The clergy who tend to the Light revere the great beast [[Mythos/The Mortal Gods/Lingzul#Vilakan, Beast of Water|Vilakan]], who the light is supposed to mimic. Many sailors leave offerings before heading out to sea in order to gain the great beast's blessing and protection.
