Better known as the Bandits of the Burning Sands, the Tsareng are a rebel tribe who live in the deserts north of [[Geography/Natural/Landforms#Steppes of Sunlight|Steppes of Sunlight]], centred around their stronghold at [[Geography/Vurnam/Tribes/Tsareng#Zahnman Deshatzi|Zahnman Deshatzi]]. Most will avoid the region entirely, circumventing it to avoid bloodshed, leading most of the Tsareng's victims to be those of raids into the surrounding territories. The Tsareng are infamous for their open [[Mythos/Fiends/Demons|demon]] worship involving mortal sacrifice and blood magic. Victims of their ritualistic murders are strung up on displays around their territory, staining the sands beneath them. Those seeking to either join their ranks or to learn their profane techniques must pay their way with blood.

## Territories
### Zahnman Deshatzi
Sandstone caverns beneath the surface, carved by long forgotten hands into ornate pillars and friezes now go unappreciated by the Tsareng who inhabit them. They provide shelter from dangers above, as well as rumours of water welling up from below the earth. Few have ever escaped the caverns alive and able to tell of their contents however, so rumours are difficult to substantiate. Some claim the Tsareng have opened a portal to [[Mythos/Realms/Infernum|Infernum]] itself, through which their foul allies may pass forth in to the [[Mythos/Realms/Material Realm|Material Realm]].
