The Vongtu occupy a stretch of scrubland that moves into the northern deserts to the north west of [[Geography/Vurnam/Major Cities/Gerting|Gerting]]. A loyalist tribe known for their copperwork, they jealously guard a number of natural mines that fall within their territory while also following roaming herds of bison and smaller game. They tend to honor [[Mythos/The Mortal Gods/Lingzul#Erang, Beast of Fire|Erang]] and [[Mythos/The Mortal Gods/Lingzul#Skanareng, Beast of Metal|Skanareng]], in addition to [[Mythos/The Mortal Gods/Lingzul|Lingzul]].

## Territories

### Coppergully
A ravine carved from gathering creek waters that run down through the scrublands to eventually reach the [[Geography/Natural/Waterways#Kulte|Kulte]], the Vongtu maintain a year-round encampment here to guard and work the local copper caves. Primarily populated during the winter months, a smaller group ensures a more permanent residence to maintain and control the caves nearby from which raw copper and turquoise is dug up.
### Hornbreaker Ridge
A fault line of winding cliff where the scrubland rises into desert, canyons in the fault offer ways down to rich copper reserves that those daring enough can claim and bring up to the surface.
### Scorpion Plateau
An open plateau on the eastern edge of Vongtu territory, it is considered a holy site by the tribe to [[Mythos/The Mortal Gods/Lingzul#Skanareng, Beast of Metal|Skanareng]] and it isn't uncommon for shamans to perform important rituals at the great stone altar in the centre of the plateau.
### Greenwater Shallows
An area of transient knee deep pools produced from rain waters collecting from the surrounding area in this local catchment spot. During periods of regular rainfall, namely in the spring, the area can experience flash flooding.
