## Ostan
*see [[Geography/Weald/Minor Towns/Ostan|Ostan]]*
A small farming community of approx 300 people, mostly producing greenwheat and longbeans. Notable structures include an unnamed makeshift tavern run by a human named Henry, and a general store run by a halfling woman Ada and her niece Chantelle.

## Fort Virouex
An abandoned [[Geography/Agercort|Agercort]] fort, the stone castle suffered great damage during a siege from [[Geography/Mallerand|Mallerand]]. Various groups of refugees and bandits have made use of the ruins over the decades, but none stay for too long and the place has garnered a shady reputation amongst superstitious farmers in the surrounding regions.

## Skwer
A hamlet with a decent proportion of gnomes for the area, with a total population of about 230 people. The village itself is constructed in an odd little gully, shielded on most sides by steep rocky overhangs. It is said that this was the site from with [[Geography/Mallerand|Mallerand]] soldiers sieged the nearby [[Geography/Weald/Villages of the Weald#Fort Virouex|Fort Virouex]]. These days the locals specialise in making pottery and flintwork from the various exposed ridges that mar the surrounding area and make largescale fields unfeasible. A gnomish woman by the name of Jerrie operates a kiln in which she makes glassware, often selling such things for a decent price at regional markets.

## Dushneela
A large tower stands here on the banks of a creek, abandoned to ruin before the [[Culture/History/Scarlett War|Scarlett War]]. An oddity, the stone from which it is built has a mild blue colour to it, unlike any stone from the area. Around it, a small village of about 80 goblins have made their home, foraging the local area and catching small fish from the creek. They have built their small lean-to shacks around the base of the tower but seem to not enter it at all. They will warn travellers who approach not to enter, for the tower is warded against intruders.

## Paglux
*see [[Geography/Weald/Minor Towns/Paglux|Paglux]]*
What was once a small farming community has grown to a larger village of around 420 people after a family of dwarves moved to the area and began work. Claiming to be following a divination of [[Mythos/The Mortal Gods/Zeva|Zeva]], they staked a claim on a plot of land and soon after struck silver. They hire a number of the locals to work their makeshift mine, and then work the ore themselves into silver coin, but also into simple ornaments and jewellery. The current head of the mines is the son of the woman who first staked the claim, Natus Forgenti. Apparently they have ties to family back in [[Geography/Mallerand#Ed Fadina|Ed Fadina]] from who they are now estranged.

## Brovink
A tidy cluster of cottages amongst a number of fields of greenwheat, approximately 460 people live in the hamlet of Brovink. The primary draw of the area is the bakery run by the alchemist Ira Vinkel, an ingenious halfling who turned her knowledge of herbs to baking. Normally greenwheat is sent either raw or as flour to towns where it must be baked locally, but Ira has used her skill to create bread which takes weeks to go stale. She sells these herb-tinged loaves to traders and travellers. The locals have made decent profit from working with Ira, and despite attempts no one yet has been able to steal or replicate the recipe.

## Bydel
*see [[Geography/Weald/Minor Towns/Bydel|Bydel]]*
What was once a [[Geography/Cruworia|Cruworia]] colony is now a farming community of about 560 people. The only thing that remains of the initial settlement is the chapel to [[Mythos/The Mortal Gods/Tenesia|Tenesia]] that remains in the centre of town. Over the decades, travellers and traders of all sorts have passed through and settled in the village as it lies on a main road to the [[Geography/Natural/Waterways#Reden|Reden]], although there are also still many [[Culture/Mortal Races/Orc|orcs]] who live there to this day. While the colony falls well beyond Cruworia's borders, it still acts as an outpost for the [[Mythos/The Mortal Gods/Tenesia#Church of the Rose|Church of the Rose]] who maintain the chapel in town.

## Slikker's Den
Abandoned until very recently, a group of about 80 have begun building and settling the land here. Populated by a group of bandits who seem to be trying to turn a new leaf, they first moved into the notorious location of the abandoned bandit nest only to discover it had been abandoned after trade routes to Odgood had been changed years ago to pass through [[Geography/Weald/Villages of the Weald#Gronmarket|Gronmarket]] further north. Rather than leave as well, it seems that they have begun to work the surrounding land and start sowing crops. Led by a half-orc called Kanya the Black, they have persisted despite their struggles in adjusting to a 'legitimate lifestyle'.

## Famarsh
A thriving settlement of nearly 1400 people, Famarsh sits on a position on the main road connecting the most fertile region of the [[Geography/Weald/Weald|Weald]] to and the border into [[Geography/Agercort|Agercort]]. While not part of the kingdom itself, it is known that they have dealings with the kingdom and it is not uncommon for an envoy to meet with the local lord of the town - a human called Lord Phillipe Gorneur. There are some who oppose his taxation on the surrounding farms and the trade through his town, but his ties to Agercort keep them from being too open or violent.

## Huur Hill
*see [[Geography/Weald/Minor Towns/Huur Hill|Huur Hill]]*
Just over 1200 people live in the community around Huur Hill. Only a couple of days from the [[Geography/Natural/Waterways#Reden|Reden]], many of the surrounding farms send their produce to the markets at Huur Hill to be sent to barges along the river, or even to join the trade caravans south towards [[Geography/Agercort|Agercort]] or [[Geography/Weald/Weald#Odgood|Odgood]]. The site itself was the setting for many skirmishes during the [[Culture/History/Scarlett War|Scarlett War]] and in the aftermath, as the eponymous hill provided a vantage point from which one could see miles in each direction. In current times, its strategic position and history have also led it to become a sort of mercenary post, with many swords-for-hire gathering at the markets as well to sell their services to the various travellers and caravans.

## Stalden
A village of about 220 people, Stalden is the primary producer of horses in the southern [[Geography/Weald/Weald|Weald]]. Rather than turn their fields to greenwheat or longbeans, their fields are pastures for their many breeding mares and their prized stud stallions. A high quality Stalden horse can be sold for a great deal, even in [[Geography/Agercort|Agercort]] or [[Geography/Cruworia|Cruworia]], the name Stalden will give a horse more value. Of course, they also produce many of the lesser quality but essential horses used as both mounts and beasts of burden throughout the region.

## Kausand
A small farming community of approximately 320 people, the village of Kausand grow longbeans and greenwheat just like most of the region. Built initially as a granary to store their produce away from raiding soldiers during the [[Culture/History/Scarlett War|Scarlett War]], their cottages are built around a old but still standing crude wooden fort that their ancestors would barricade themselves in. With a well and all their food stores inside, it proved enough to keep them going despite constant raids from all sides, making them one of the oldest continuous settlements in the sourthern [[Geography/Weald/Weald|Weald]].

## Heksel
Sitting on the edges of the [[Geography/Natural/Waterways#Sullen Swamp|Sullen Swamp]] lies the community of Heksel. With approximately 190 people living there, many travellers are wary upon entering and seeing the odd fetishes and trinkets strung up around town. The townsfolk are run by a small coven of witches who rather than hide themselves away in the swamps, offer their services of medicine and protection to the farmfolk of the [[Geography/Weald/Weald|Weald]]. These witches of the Kurafi Coven are currently led by the wizened witch Maglissa, a blind woman said to be over a hundred years old.

## Noldor
On the less fertile lands bordering the [[Geography/Natural/Waterways#Sullen Swamp|Sullen Swamp]], the people of Noldor manage to cultivate the more rigorous swedeleaf as their primary crop. The vegetable takes longer to grow and are often planted later in the year, meaning that when many people are sowing their greenwheat or longbeans, the approximately 410 people of Noldor are harvesting their swedeleaf. This means that many towns in the region are somewhat reliant on swedeleaf farmers for cheap food during this time of year, and Noldor has some of the best soil for the crop.

## Kelbarrow
A small chapel to [[Mythos/The Mortal Gods/Drytog|Drytog]] sits here and watches over the burial grounds nearby where many were interred in a rush during the [[Culture/History/Scarlett War|Scarlett War]]. It seems that corpseplague had become a problem, and so both side were keen to get the dead into the ground quickly, resulting in mass graves that often went without proper rites or recognition. As such, the area has had consistent problems with pestilence and necromancy. The chapel here is overseen by a dwarven cleric called Fortis. He regularly has his clerics patrol the grounds, and regularly visits nearby communities and farmsteads with an eye for early signs of darkness.

## Seklub
The site of a large manor house, now converted into a bordello and inn. Acting as a sort of caravan post, there are approx 280 permanent residents in the cluster of cottages and stores catering to the various travellers and merchants passing through. The bordello at the centre of town is run by a human woman called Courtney Covointe. She claims to be a descendent of the original owners of the manor.

## Lingkerk
A collection of cottages and local crafters built around a small chapel to [[Mythos/The Mortal Gods/Lingzul|Lingzul]]. The chapel draws seasonal visitors from many of the nearby hamlets seeking blessings for crop harvests. The main cleric is an elvish woman called Mutzi who has lived in Lingkerk her whole life. Other notables amongst the approx 380 people, are a human blacksmith called George who makes and maintains many of the farming tools of the surrounding area.

## Rakki
This hovel of crude shacks and sheds on the edge of the [[Geography/Natural/Forests#Grey Forest|Grey Forest]] is home to about 190 goblins. They subsist of gathered herbs and roots along with small game and a couple of crude vegetable gardens. Relatively isolated from other goblin communities, they are often the victim of bandits or criminals, as most of the non-goblin settlements nearby will do little to help them.

## Tulbon
One of many of the small farming communities in the area, most of the approx 290 people here are farmers of greenwheat and longbeans. The main reason anyone might venture here is the residence of Mizziscum the Mage, a supposedly [[Culture/Factions/College of Night|College]] trained wizard who has chosen this uninteresting hamlet to retire to in his old age. Occasionally he will help locals with small tasks in order to support himself.

## Wenee
With only 170 people living here, Wenee consists mostly of fieldworkers who spend most of the year farming. They are a closed community however, occupying what was once an [[Geography/Agercort|Agercort]] outpost, complete with palisade wall. Having repurposed the abandoned outpost, they rarely leave and frequently turn away travellers.

## Adrop
A farming community of about 230 people, Adrop is a quiet little side village. The only thing of note is the nearby crypt, built during the [[Culture/History/Scarlett War|Scarlett War]] it houses many who died in the fighting. The townsfolk tend to give it a wide berth, although there is a local halfling cleric of [[Mythos/The Mortal Gods/Drytog|Drytog]] by the name of Truvor who visits it regularly to ensure it is properly maintained.

## Bomeen
Approx 220 people have built their houses around the central point of Bomeen, a singular large pear tree of unusual proportions. The people there refer to it as Old Sweet, and believe it to be a lucky mascot of the surrounding fields' fertility. Bomeen is also home to Coritch, an orcish dog trainer. He can often be seen running his hunting dogs in drills through the fallow fields outside of town.

## Bostaak
*see [[Geography/Weald/Minor Towns/Bostaak|Bostaak]]*
A larger collection of various farmsteads who have since grown to a small village of about 360 people, Bostaak primarily produces both longbeans and is the primary producer of brownbeans in the region. It is said that the secret to cultivating the brownbeans, which are notoriously difficult to do this far south, comes from one of the goblin families in town. The current head of the family is an old man named Sem-sem. As a result the people of Bostaak are quite happy to deal with goblins, and indeed they rely on them to continue to profit and grow.

## Gronmarket
*see [[Geography/Weald/Minor Towns/Gronmarket|Gronmarket]]*
The largest of the villages in the region, Gronmarket is a small town with about 1280 people present. It has a number of stores built around a central market square. It is here that many of the other local communities bring their produce to sell, or to be taken to [[Geography/Weald/Weald#Odgood|Odgood]] or further. The cluster of stores and cottages has its own chapel to [[Mythos/The Mortal Gods/Panismé|Panismé]], an inn by the name of the Giant's Table, as well as a smithy and a small curio store.

## Gidjrot Cave
A system of underground caverns and tunnels, a halfling shaman by the name of Tonari lives in a hut near the main entrance. There are a number of rare herbs and mushrooms that grow within the caves, although the caves aren't entirely safe. Tonari will occasionally gather and sell such herbs, but she will caution novices from trying to explore the caves.

## Fort Onkleg
Once an independent stronghold during the [[Culture/History/Scarlett War|Scarlett War]], Fort Onkleg was sieged and claimed by differing armies at various points. It became renowned for its various layers of defence against intruders, from trapped doors and corridors, to internal layouts designed to confuse and restrict movement. For many years after the [[Culture/History/Scarlett War#The Burgundy Treatise|Burgundy Treatise]] it sat silent, only a skeleton guard from [[Mallerand]] who had last taken the fort but was know uncertain with what claim they held it. In the first decades after the end of the war, there were many lingering pockets of discontent across the continent - those who had been fighting for generations and were struggling to relinquish their bloodlust. And so Fort Onkleg became the answer, a prison for any who threatened the newfound peace and guarded by members from each of the four kingdoms. In the year 43 3E, travellers passing by the prison reported signs of smoke and upon investigation could not get any response from beyond the closed portcullis. Further attempts to contact anyone within failed, and attempts to force entrance resulted in heavy casualties and a conclusion that a prison riot had resulted in the guards being overthrown. With little motivation to try and reclaim the prison, the kingdoms abandoned it.

## Fort Thammil
An old [[Geography/Cruworia|Cruworian]] fort a few days south of [[Geography/Weald/Weald#Gemend|Gemend]], it was abandoned in the first decade after the [[Culture/History/Scarlett War#The Burgundy Treatise|Burgundy Treatise]] as the orc crusaders withdrew from the Weald. It didn't take long for opportunistic bandits to take the structure. Built with access to a small slough that opens up to the [[Geography/Natural/Waterways#Ilma|Ilma]] during the spring and summer, the new inhabitants soon took up small skiffs that they used to pirate trade barges. While the bandits have been pushed out time and time again by both mercenaries hired by frustrated traders, or even orcish crusader platoons sent by angered Cruworian traders, they always return. It's never been viable to keep the fort occupied to keep the bandits out, and before long they return. In modern times most have simply accepted the pirates as fact, often paying "protection" to keep themselves safe, while Cruworian barges have simply added contingents of crusaders to their barges to prevent further piracy. There are still those poor enough or reckless enough to trade through Gemend without paying protection and risking a boarding.

## Fort Justice
*see [[Geography/Weald/Fort Justice|Fort Justice]]*
An anomaly amongst the sometimes depraved lawlessness of the [[Geography/Weald/Weald|Weald]], Fort Justice was once a [[Geography/Cruworia|Cruworian]] battlement that fell to the armies of [[Geography/Agercort|Agercort]] during the [[Culture/History/Scarlett War|Scarlett War]]. Not long after the signing of the [[Culture/History/Scarlett War#The Burgundy Treatise|Burgundy Treatise]], a new group of residents called it home - the Order of the White Rose. This order of knights, most of whom were originally from Agercort or the southern Weald, rebuilt the ruins and restored it to glory, renaming it when they did. They were an order dedicated to [[Mythos/The Mortal Gods/Tenesia|Tenesia]], but not at all affiliated with the [[Mythos/The Mortal Gods/Tenesia#Church of the Rose|Church of the Rose]]. Instead they took Tenesia's edicts of virtue and transformation and set out into the war torn continent on a mission to help rebuild the ruins into a shining new world. From their central headquarters they began to make a name for themselves as an order of knights who could be trusted to enforce fair justice, help the innocent and downtrodden, and maintain the peace. Over the decades they have grown in influence, and have drawn recruits from across the Weald to rally under their banner at Fort Justice.

## Tinelgar Mines
*see [[Geography/Weald/Tinelgar Mines|Tinelgar Mines]]*
Where the [[Geography/Natural/Waterways#Reden|Reden]] begins to branch into the [[Geography/Natural/Waterways#Ilma|Ilma]] sits a stretch of riverbank eroded away over centuries. It is here that the Stoutwart Company have been mining galena for decades at the Tinelgar Mines. Although in use before the [[Culture/History/Scarlett War|Scarlett War]], it was too exposed for operation to continue through most of the fighting. It is only in the past decade that the Stoutwart Company launched efforts from nearby [[Geography/Weald/Weald#Gemend|Gemend]] to re-open the mines. It seems that during the absence of the miners, sections of the mines have caved in, been vandalised, or even been occupied by creatures.

## Lagaven Mines
Mined by goblin tribes since time immemorial, the bog caves of the Lagaven Mines are treacherous and suffocating, but they also supply a good deal of bog iron to the [[Geography/Natural/Waterways#Sullen Swamp|Sullen Swamp]]. It is not uncommon for would-be warlords to try and take the mines from the local goblins - and sometimes they are able to succeed for a time. Guerilla warfare from the displaced goblins and untenable working conditions in the mines themselves tend to drive them away before too long.

## Dryadnest
