Where the [[Geography/Natural/Waterways#Ilma|Ilma]] River branches off the [[Geography/Natural/Waterways#Reden|Reden]] amidst the cliffs and rocky bluffs, there have for centuries been excavations at the Tinelgar Mines. Primarily producing large amounts of galena ore, which is then further refined to lead as well as silver, often after first being shipped to the smelters at [[Geography/Weald/Minor Towns/Leddock|Leddock]]. During the [[Culture/History/Scarlett War|Scarlett War]], fighting around the mines became so high, with many ore-bearing barges being sunk, that mining ceased. Now, decades after the [[Culture/History/Scarlett War#The Burgundy Treatise|Burgundy Treatise]], the Stoutwart Company has made moves from [[Geography/Weald/Major Cities/Gemend|Gemend]] to reopen the mines. These attempts have been going on for some years now, but problems have plagued the endeavour, from financial issues, to worker issues, cave-ins, piracy - it has now become an insidious rumour that the mines are cursed.
