A walled city-state of over 2,250 people, situated on the fork of the [[Waterways#Ilma|Ilma]] and the [[Waterways#Reden|Reden]] rivers.
## Inkeridge Dockyards
The major dockyards in Gemend, sat along the northern side of town along the shore of the Reden most ships moving either inland or out to [[Geography/Port Manteaux|Port Manteaux]] will pass through here. Owned by Lady Inkeridge, inherited from her late father, it is probably one of the most diverse thoroughfare ports in the continent. As such, a great deal of wealth is made from the taxes and tariffs on those passing through.
## Gharma Docks
At the start of the Ilma river, beneath the shadow of [[Geography/Weald/Major Cities/Gemend#Antler Hill|Antler Hill]], sits the Gharma Docks. Here any boats coming in or out of the [[Geography/Natural/Forests#Grey Forest|Grey Forest]], and most likely [[Geography/Cruworia|Cruworia]], will stop to either trade, resupply, or turn back. Primarily run by the Afework family, there are also other smaller businesses who work along the docks here as well. A number of apostates come through here, greeted often with a mixture of pity or revile.
## Chalk Plaza
The main market square in Gemend, names after its white stone pavement, the square is owned by Lady Inkeridge meaning the merchants who set up their stalls here pay her rent for the privilege to do so. It is often worth it however, as getting a good spot in Chalk Plaza not only allows you good opportunity to sell to the local populace, but also those coming through Gemend by boat. Many travellers disembark never to get past Chalk Plaza, so the closer one is to the main road through, the higher the profit - and the rent.
## Antler Hill
On the western side of town, beyond the inner streets and at the highest point among the bluffs is Antler Hill, an old temple grounds dedicated to [[Mythos/The Mortal Gods/Lingzul|Lingzul]] and the Beast [[Mythos/The Mortal Gods/Lingzul#Yemon, Beast of Wood|Yemon]]. One of the oldest structures in town, it is an odd solace from the urban buzz of the trade city. Donations from many of the businesses in town ensure that all the temple's needs are met, with many just considering their regular donations akin to a tax made in order to ensure continued favour with the divine.
## Chapel of Vice and Virtue
A church of [[Mythos/The Mortal Gods/Panismé|Panismé]], with an added on shrine to [[Mythos/The Mortal Gods/Zeva#Zephyr, the Shooting Star|Zephyr]], the Chapel sits amongst many of Gemend's gambling houses. Whether seeking solace from the hard realities of life, or seeking blessings and luck before heading next door, many of the poorer folk in town regularly frequent the chapel.
