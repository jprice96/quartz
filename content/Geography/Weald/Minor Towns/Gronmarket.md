A larger community of around 1260 people built around a central marketplace where local farmers sell their wares along the main trade route.
## Lord Veeler
De facto lord of Gronmarket, Lord Gulligan Veeler owns a great deal of the farmland around Gronmarket and has also invested into many of the local shops and businesses in town. He also imposes a minor tax on the trade in town which goes towards maintenance of town infrastructure and the hiring of a small town guard. Most townsfolk genuinely appreciate Lord Veeler's generosity and patronage, often claiming that it is his actions that have allowed Gronmarket to prosper and fend of would be bandit attacks.

Lord Veeler himself is a particularly obese gnome, some seventy years old, who lives in a manor house in the fields outside town. He is a devout follower of [[Mythos/The Mortal Gods/Panismé|Panismé]], and is constantly indulging his sweet tooth at every chance he can get. It is not uncommon for him to throw small parties at his house and have travelling musicians and performers come to entertain himself and his guests. It is this joy-seeking life that Lord Veeler claims has kept him in good health without losing even a speck of colour in all his years. His particular favourite though is adventurers, unable to partake in the activity himself, he is a patron of adventurers that they might come and regale him of their wondrous escapades. A small guild of adventurers have formed in Gronmarket as a result of his patronage, supplementing the town guard, calling themselves the [[Geography/Weald/Minor Towns/Gronmarket#The Intrepideers|Intrepideers]].

## The Intrepideers
Members have come and gone over the twenty or so years since the guild was established. Since then, thanks to Lord Veeler's patronage, they have managed to build a guildhall just outside of town. The main practicing members at current time are Lenta the Brash, Scrap, Bliksa the Blythe, and their leader Tristan of [[Geography/Weald/Villages of the Weald#Tulbon|Tulbon]]. Their most recent recruit is a young girl called Wisteria, rescued from an expedition to the edge of the [[Geography/Natural/Waterways#Sullen Swamp|Sullen Swamp]] from the witches of [[Geography/Weald/Villages of the Weald#Heksel|Heksel]], she apparently requested to join the group. The other notable member of their guild is Meritte, a retired [[Geography/Agercort|Agercort]] woman who is too old to tag along now but manages the guildhall. She is one of the original Intrepideers.

## The Giant's Table
The local tavern and inn, run by local woman Elli, she is a kind but abnormally large (just comes on the lower end of Large at about 2.7m tall) human. The inn was built in part by her, and has accommodations for her unusual stature. She is a good host, but often overworked so can be snappy, she is also intimidating enough with an iron saucepan to quell most would be rabble rousers. She has about a half dozen rooms upstairs with a bed, and another two rooms with double beds.

## The Chicken's Claw
A small shop just off the main market square, run by Ruben, a young human who makes and sells many of the talismans and trinkets in the store. He is always willing to buy some of the more unusual raw materials he needs if there are hunters or travellers willing to put in the work to acquire them. He has no real knack for spellcasting or anything, but he has sufficient occult and alchemical knowledge to craft all manner of talismans and charms. He also stocks a small amount of scrolls, potions, and other alchemical goods but his supply is largely dependent on what happens to pass through town.

## Zusto's Clinic
The halfling Zusto runs a small clinic in town where he helps with sprains, broken bones, colds and other minor ailments. He has some training in alchemy and medicine, and a couple of magical cures he keeps in reserve for emergencies that he got from a [[Mythos/The Mortal Gods/Drytog|White Cleric]] that came through town not long ago.

## Chapel of Panismé
A small chapel that holds sermons maybe once or twice a week, it is run and maintained by Huismé along with her two acolytes Kroker and Rose. The chapel offers religious counsel and holds regular ceremonies and services. They are also able to provide certain divine spellcasting services as well as artistic supplies, namely paints and dyes of various colours.
