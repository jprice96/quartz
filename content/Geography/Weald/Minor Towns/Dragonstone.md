Abandoned for most of the [[Culture/History/Scarlett War|Scarlett War]], Dragonstone is an ancient settlement build around a grand stone temple of sorts. History books teach that this place was once home to a great green dragon who ruled over the temple and surrounding land, but after the [[Culture/History/Dragondeath|Dragondeath]] it sat as a monastery of sorts for years before eventually falling to abandon. As refugees sought sanctuary following the [[Culture/History/Scarlett War#The Burgundy Treatise|Burgundy Treatise]], some re-founded the settlement here, shaking off superstitions and clearing away centuries of disuse. While some still feel uneasy around the ancient architecture of Dragonstone, the place is now home to approximately 460 people from all manner of origins, mingled together over a generation or two.

Some archaeologists and arcanists have now seen fit to explore the ruins with a "fresh century's perspective", in the hopes of discovering secrets still buried there. Others have instead attempted to revive the old monastic traditions based off remnants of their texts mixed with modern techniques, founding what has been dubbed the Monks of the Green Flame.
