Situated on a small cove at the beginnings of the [[Geography/Natural/Waterways#Ilma|Ilma River]] on the edge of the [[Geography/Natural/Forests#Grey Forest|Grey Forest]], Bebmeir was once a [[Geography/Cruworia|Cruworian]] trading post before the borders receded after the [[Culture/History/Scarlett War#The Burgundy Treatise|Burgundy Treatise]]. It still acts as a stopping point for many trade ships heading to or from [[Geography/Cruworia#Kuramise|Kuramise]]. It also acts as a crossing point for those coming from [[Geography/Weald/Major Cities/Gemend|Gemend]] wanting to head into the [[Geography/Weald/Villages of the Weald|southern Weald]] on foot rather than heading upriver.

As is often the case with old Cruworian settlements, there is a heavy [[Culture/Mortal Races/Orc|orcish]] presence in both the population and the architecture, although many others have now begun to integrate into the town given its official independence from the kingdom resulting in a mixed population of about 400. In addition to the trade going through, Bebmeir also has a history of pottery, gathering clay from the shore up as far as [[Geography/Weald/Tinelgar Mines|Tinelgar Mines]] and with a large array of kilns that have stood in the town for some say centuries. The galena ore once produced at the mines was often used to glaze and reinforce the clay pottery.
