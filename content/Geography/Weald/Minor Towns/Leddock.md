A fraction of it's former self, Leddock currently only has a population of about 290, but was close to double that centuries earlier when the [[Geography/Weald/Tinelgar Mines|Tinelgar Mines]] were still open. Much of the ore would be shipped upstream to Leddock where large smelters and forges would refine and work it before shipping it either to markets in [[Geography/Weald/Major Cities/Gemend]], or elsewhere. Since the mines closed during the fighting of the [[Culture/History/Scarlett War|Scarlett War]] however, many were forced to either flee the fighting or simply look for work elsewhere. Now many of the large brick buildings of Leddock are empty and in disarray, with most folks only occupying the buildings along the water's edge where they make a living fishing and catering to ships travelling along the [[Geography/Natural/Waterways#Reden|Reden]].
