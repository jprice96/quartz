A farming village of approximately 300 people, most of whom are farmers working the local fields for crops of greenwheat and longbean.
## General Store
There is a general store in town run by an older halfling woman Ada and her niece Chantelle. Ada has lived in Ostan her whole life, while Chantelle moved from Gronmarket a couple of years back to help Ada with the store. They mostly sell clothing and leatherwork, with both Ada and Chantelle frequently mending or making simple clothes for the locals and Chantelle buying the leather from local hunters to treat and work. Ada also makes preserves and jams when she can which she also sells to travellers.

## Tavern
There is no official tavern in Ostan, but one of the local farmers, a human called Henry, produces beer in his spare time as a hobby. It is popular enough that he added a small extension on to his house, enough to fit his fermenting equipment and a couple of crude benches and stools. He sells the produce to the locals and any bold enough travellers passing though. On the odd occasion he has also allowed travellers to spend the night on the straw floor for a cheap fare.

## Other Residents
Bram, a respected voice in Ostan, the halfling has worked the land there for decades, as his father did before him. Level-headed, but wary of outsiders, Bram's word carries weight with the other villagers.

Lucas, one of the local halfling youths who prefers to spend his time hunting. He typically stays in the fields around Ostan, nabbing rabbits and such, but occasionally he will head further afield on extended hunting trips with some of the others.

Lotte, a busybody who never knows when to keep her mouth shut. She is a gnomish woman who moved to Ostan about seven years ago with a new babe and nothing else. The townsfolk helped her get back on her feet and she has stayed to raise her son Avery. She works washing clothes and watching the other small children during the day as she heads house to house collecting and delivering laundry.

Claude, a bit of an outcast due to their introverted nature, the human Claude moved to Ostan as a small child. Their parents died about a decade ago, and they have only become more reclusive since. They work their own small fields, but produce the best quality crops in the village and many say that they must have plant magics. If they do, they don't make a large deal about it or show it off in anyway.

Noah, a human youth itching to leave town but barely old enough to be on his own. Only just turned fourteen, Noah struggles to understand the contentment that the rest of the townsfolk have in their day to day life of being farmers. He is desperate for anything to happen, often trying to talk to any newcomers to town and taking every opportunity to go to Gronmarket.
