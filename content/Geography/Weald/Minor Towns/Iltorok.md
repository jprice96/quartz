A small farming community of approximately 230, Iltorok is a relatively unremarkable village. It was razed during the [[Culture/History/Scarlett War|Scarlett War]], but was rebuilt about twenty years after it ended as people returned to the area. The fields, while fallow, were already largely cleared, there were wells and main roads - whatever the initial reason to settle here was, for this new generation it was merely a matter of convenience. The nearby presence of [[Geography/Weald/Fort Justice|Fort Justice]] means the region is relatively safe as well.
