A farming community of approximately 350, Crospick is also well known for the presence of the local [[Mythos/The Mortal Gods/Drytog#Whitesun Lodge|Whitesun Lodge]] just north of town. Sitting on the shore of Lake Whitemare, the people supplement their annual crops of greenwheat with regular fishing. The presence of the Lodge informs a great deal of the traffic and business that goes on through Crospick.
