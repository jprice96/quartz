## King Tyrell of Agercort

## King Edric of Cruworia

Many who meet the man in person however are quick to dismiss any illusions regarding the man's piety. His loyalty to the Church is absolute and all that he does is in accordance with it's wishes. This lead others to believe he is a puppet, but this is a dangerous misconception as well. Edric is a man of charisma, wit, and strategy, and while he acts in the Church's best interests, he also acts without need for command or instruction.
## King Ognan of Mallerand

## Queen Rogarka of Vurnam
The queen of [[Geography/Vurnam|Vurnam]] is known as a brash woman who is quick to anger, something some put down to her youth.

This leads her now to use military shows of might to try and intimidate unruly tribes into obedience, a strategy that may prove ineffective in the long term.
