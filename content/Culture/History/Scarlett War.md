title: "Scarlett War"
---

For almost 300 years the entire continent was at war. Termed the Scarlett War, the triggering events that led to the conflict are still debated and may not ever be agreed upon. What is agreed upon is that the four kingdoms of modern Burgundy were in constant conflict with each other, and while the majority of the outright warfare took place in what is now the [Weald](Geography/Weald/Weald.md), fighting extended well into all of the kingdoms' modern territory at various points in time.

## The Burgundy Treatise
Following almost two years of diplomatic meetings, border negotiations, and many setbacks, in the winter of 0 3E all four kingdoms ratified the Burgundy Treatise finally calling an end to the Scarlett War and the beginning of the Third Era. The [Weald](Geography/Weald/Weald.md) was left as independent, under the direct authority of no kingdom, and the people who found a home there could finally begin to rebuild and recover from the centuries of war. The Treatise was largely recognised as the work of [Sophia Pistis](Culture/People/Sophia%20Pistis.md), and many of the war revivalists over the years have claimed that she used witchcraft and blackmail to coerce the leaders of the kingdoms into ceasefire. The kingdoms are quick to shut down such insurrections however so as not to risk violating the Treatise as whoever breaks it at this point is surely looking at a war of three versus one.

## Causes of the War

### Agercort
The biggest proponents of the Burgundy Treatise, many outsiders find it hard to believe that [Agercort](Geography/Agercort.md) ever had any interest in the Scarlett War. It is true that Agercort has come far since the end of the war, but at the time they were just as invested in the conflict as the other kingdoms. According to Agercort, the War was a fight for emancipation. The other kingdoms were tyrannical, suppressing their populaces with harsh religious laws which were heavily prejudiced and unjust. The armies of Agercort sought not to conquer, but to liberate those victimised by the brutal regimes of the other kingdoms. The offered asylum to any refugees of the other kingdoms, often using them to bolster their own forces on the front line. Freedom was not free, and it was the duty of Agercort to ensure that they would fight until the last before they would give up their liberties.

### Cruworia
It is no secret that there are parties in [Cruworia](Geography/Cruworia.md) who decry the Burgundy Treatise and openly proclaim that victory for Cruworia was inevitable. As long as these words never turn into open action, it seems that [[Culture/Important People#King Edric of Cruworia|King Edric]] is content to let them be, which some take as silent support. The [[Mythos/The Mortal Gods/Tenesia#Church of the Rose|Church of the Rose]] is very clear about the cause of the Scarlett War - it was a crusade against the heathens of the continent and their divine mission to bring the light of [Tenesia](Mythos/The%20Mortal%20Gods/Tenesia.md) to all. The people of Cruworia recognise Tenesia above all other deities and believe that until all acknowledge her glory the world will continue to be plagued by the evils of the world. Their crusaders were some of the most feared warriors in the war, they were unyielding and merciless, as they continue to be in modern times.

### Vurnam
The tribes of [Vurnam](Geography/Vurnam.md) cooperate on few things, but the Scarlett War united them behind a single cause for centuries as they put their internal conflicts aside to become a single voice wielding the largest military force in history. For the tribes, the war was about survival. The other kingdoms had begun to befoul the land with dark magic and toxic industry, stripping it of natural resources and life-giving systems. The tribes argued ceaselessly about a course of action, until the [[Mythos/The Mortal Gods/Lingzul#The Zirbaum|Zirbaum]] died. Almost overnight the tribes unified into a single body, determining the only just response was war. Wherever they went they made sure to put to torch temples, workshops, anything they felt might stain the land.

### Mallerand
Often seen as isolationists, even those who live in [Mallerand](Geography/Mallerand.md) in modern times are not sure what could have provoked them to wage war beyond their borders. Those truly interested will find themselves heading to the archives in [[Geography/Mallerand#Arx Saxum|Arx Saxum]] where they will find records and decrees dating back centuries before the Treatise. There is a period of three years in these meticulous records that don't exist. Prior to that point, Mallerand was content with the other kingdoms, but following it they were in all out war. What happened in those three years is seemingly unknown, with all official records seemingly lost or destroyed from the years between 287 2E and 283 2E. Whatever the cause, once Mallerand had been roused to war, their own tendency towards tradition and stubborn lack of inertia seemed to lock them in to the war simply because it was what their parents had done, and their parents before them. Their entire culture had shifted to be based on being at war, and even in modern times there are still elements of this remaining.
