The Season of Dragondeath marked the end of the [[Culture/History/Timeline of the Material Realm#Age of Dragons|Age of Dragons]]. While little survives of that Age, what is remembered is that within the span of approximately a year almost every dragon known to mortals perished suddenly. There are theories of a disease or a curse spreading rapidly across the dragons, but the actual cause has not been identified.
