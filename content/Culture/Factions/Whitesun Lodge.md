Effectively the organised church of [[Mythos/The Mortal Gods/Drytog|Drytog]], the Whitesun Lodge represent a far-reaching network of clergy that spans the whole continent. Each Lodge itself contains resident clergy trained in healing, funerary rituals, and combat against undeath, as well as being halls of recordkeeping often better than anything else in the area. From each Lodge however is sent a constant rotation of roaming [[Culture/Factions/Whitesun Lodge#Journeymen|journeymen]] who ply such trades across the countryside to those without regular access to a Lodge themselves. They are commonly renowned for being helpful and competent do-gooders, although there are rare cases of impersonators who take advantage of this goodwill (something the Lodges do not look kindly upon).
## Lodge Structure
Within each Lodge, regardless of location, there is a shared structure meaning someone can walk into a Lodge anywhere on the continent and have at least some idea of who to see for a given problem
### High Cleric
The leader of a Lodge, the high cleric is often seen as a devout conduit to Drytog himself. They are the spiritual leader of the commune and have final say on all matters of both daily matters and larger decisions. When a high cleric dies, or steps down for other reasons, their replacement is elected by other high clerics from neighbouring Lodges. Sometimes these are already established individuals being promoted from other positions, sometimes they are completely green recruits. The reasoning behind such decisions can't be questioned, but the individual must be sponsored by three high clerics to be officially appointed.
### Head Healer
Knowledgeable in all kinds of healing, from magic to alchemy to mundane medicine. The head healer, when not overseeing the care of the Lodge's sick and wounded, is responsible for educating recruits in the healing arts.
### Head Keeper
As a god of remembrance, part of a Lodge's responsibility is to keep records and annals of history, that they may be remembered for eras to come. The head keeper is in charge of the creation and protection of these records, often taking the role of a librarian. Many Lodges are sought after by adventurers not seeking medical aid, but academic aid.
### Head Eulogist
Ensuring that the dead rest with finality, the head eulogist oversees the practice of final rites and teaches new recruits in such things. Additionally, the head eulogist is called upon when such matters go awry. They are masters of channelling vital magics, not to heal the living but to turn the undead back to the grave.
### Journeymen
While there are permanent residents of each Lodge and a number of students, many of the clergy are journeymen - clerics who wander the surrounding regions offering healing services and performing final rites, returning to Lodges in order to resupply or to alert higher ups to concerning signs of disease or undeath they have come across.
