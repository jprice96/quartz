## Drosmint
*Location:* Common continent-wide, always near running fresh water
*Description:* Typically growing up to 2 inches tall, drosmint grows as a cluster of fleshy pale green leaves in a lotus-like formation. The leaves are slightly fuzzy and firm. Produces a single blue flower in the middle of the plant when flowering. 
*Usage:* Often used in the treatment of burns and broken skin, the sap inside the leaves produces a cold tingling sensation when applied. Small amounts are sometimes added to food to create a minty flavour, but excess consumption will result in diarrhea and cramping.
## Gachfeln
*Location:* Found in rocky regions, typically growing in chalky soil
*Description:* Also called milk daisies, they are short single stems that grow up to 4-5 inches tall and ending in a single star-shaped flower with cream coloured petals. These flowers eventually shrivel and dry into hardened sails that can carry the seeds on the wind some distance.
*Usage:* Fresh flowers can be steeped in boiling water and then left to make a cold tea that looks like cloudy milk. It is a common supplement given to young children by nagging parents in order to help them grow up strong, but it is also prescribed to those suffering from broken or brittle bones.
## Lameng Lily
*Location:* Scrubland and savannah of Vurnam and the northern Weald
*Description:* Growing many branched thin thorny stems up to 2ft tall, both the stems and small leaves are dark brown. When in bloom, the ends of all the stems produce small red trumpet-shaped flowers with golden stamen.
*Usage:* Both the flowers and the thorns of the lameng lily are used in various kinds of elven witchcraft. The roots are harvested and dried for medicinal use, chewed as a numbing agent for those in pain or in need of field surgery.
## Lohee
*Location:* Found in the bayou and delta regions of the Reden
*Description:* Small tangles of twisting green vine about a foot tall and wide, growing on more stable soil amidst the swamps of the east. Called the swamp rose by Cruworian travellers, the flowers bloom as large red pompoms around 3 inches in diameter and filled with dozens of small hard black seeds the size of an ant. 
*Usage:* The seeds are gathered and crushed into a powder used to spice local foods, giving a mild heat and a metallic aftertaste. It is common for the goblins to give lohee spiced soup to those injured by beasts and men alike.
## Gembroot
*Location:* Found in temperate forested areas
*Description:* Growing to around 2ft tall, often around the base of larger trees, gembroot plants typically have one main stem, with a couple of smaller branching stems. Heart-shaped leaves sprout from all the stems at regular intervals, while the main stem will end in a comb of small yellow flowers. The roots are quite thick, often growing around the larger roots of a nearby tree.
*Usage:* The roots of the plant are often foraged and can be eaten raw, cooked, or steeped in teas or soups. They are quite bitter, but also slightly sweet, and it is said to alleviate headaches, nausea, and other mild symptoms of common illnesses.
## Scorey Leaves
*Location:* Pastoral regions of the Weald, often in fallow fields or as weeds
*Description:* A single ring of spiky-edged coarse leaves with a single stem growing up to about 4 inches and dotted with multiple pale purple flowers along the stem. The flower petals end in a serrated edge, almost like little teeth. The leaves grow quite large, typically around 2 inches wide and 4-5 inches long, the central vein often having a darker reddish streak while the leaves are very dark green.
*Usage:* The leaves are commonly chewed as a pastime, and are mildly addictive. They are also sometimes used in cooking to add a smoky nutty flavour. While generally considered acceptable, it is a commonly held belief that pregnant people should not chew the leaf although there doesn't seem to be any definitive proof of harm.
## Bedside Daisy
*Location:* Common among open grassy areas across the continent
*Description:* Long single stems up to 4 inches tall, with a single simple white flower at the top. They often grow in clusters of a half dozen or so, and are commonly mistaken for [[Culture/Herbs and Foraging#Gachfeln|milk daisies]]. The primary difference is that bedside daisies turn yellow at the very centre of the flower.
*Usage:* The flowers can be brewed into a tea, or slipped into a stew or soup, leaving only a mildly honeyed aftertaste. Such consumption will result in a delayed but heavy drowsiness after about an hour following consumption.
## Luctus
*Location:* Found in Mallerand year round, and Agercort during the cold half of the year
*Description:* Multiple sprigs of fine green stems covered in thin frilly foliage, growing up to 1ft tall. Separate sprigs will sometimes feature hundreds of pin-sized white flowers instead of leaves.
*Usage:* The leaves can be boiled and eaten, or dried and ground into a powder tea, and are prescribed as a treatment for aches and fever. Care must be taken however as not much more is needed to overdose, resulting in an agonizing poison that induces strong cramping, cold sweats, internal bleeding, and even death.
## Red Devilroot
*Location:* Found growing in warmer waters along the shoreline
*Description:* The roots of the plant are typically submerged below the waterline, although may become exposed at low tide. The stem and foliage of the plant is purple-red and fine, growing about 2-3 inches above the water with long ferny tendrils. The roots are bright red with a hardened thorny composition.
*Usage:* The roots of the plant can be ground up into a red powder that has a few uses. When ingested, it is said to sharpen the mind, while some elves apply it topically around the eyes claiming it enhances vision.
## Svarberries
*Location:* Mallerand, high elevations
*Description:* Bushes around 2-3 ft tall with long curled leaves, the berries are produced in bunches on long stems hanging from the bush. Each berry is about the size of a fingernail, but about half of the volume is a single hard seed. The berries are a bright red with a shiny skin.
*Usage:* The berries are often eaten to aid with issues regarding altitude changes, or respiratory problems in general, seeming to clear any breathing difficulties for a while after eating. The seeds are often gathered and ground into a potent spice called svardum spice, which is often highly valued in areas where the svarberry isn't locally available. The spice is described as "tasting of everything"
## Vozhubloom
*Location:* Lower foothills of Mallerand and along the Kulte river
*Description:* Tall wood stalks of up to 4ft tall with forked leaves sprouting along the whole length and ending in a cluster of spider-like pink flowers. Often found growing in thickets together, capable of creating a dense mass of the plant.
*Usage:* The flowers produce a nectar that can only be collected from the living plant. This nectar can be a quite potent all-cure and antitoxin, but it quickly spoils after collection if not magically or alchemically preserved.
## Angelroot
*Location:* Grey Forest
*Description:* A small plant on the surface only about 4 inches tall, often growing amidst other underbrush, it has a small many branched stem lined with short straight leaves of a dull grey colour. Its roots are more extensive, often reaching up to a foot beyond the plant above. They form a tangled network of main roots connected with a spiderweb of fine white plant sinews.
*Usage:* The roots are carefully collected to try and preserve the white connections as much as possible. The roots can then used to filter water through, purifying most poisons or toxins from the water. It is also said that the roots can be smoked or smudged to cleanse negative energies.
