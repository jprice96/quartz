## Greenwheat
*Climate: Temperate to warm
Growing Season: Late autumn - midsummer*
One of the most prolific staple crops across the continent, it is grown throughout the [[Geography/Weald/Weald|Weald]]. Planted before winter starts, the seeds will sprout into thick grass around 3-4ft tall. Green most of the year round, come the summer it will begin to rapidly change into a golden-brown signifying the harvest season. The grains are often ground into flour, while the straw is often used for a variety of purposes in different areas of the Weald from livestock fodder to building materials. It keeps well as long as it is kept dry and so is often planted on a large scale and then kept year round.
## Longbean
*Climate: Temperate to cool
Growing Season: Midspring - Early autumn*
A common complement to [[Culture/Crops and Agriculture#Greenwheat|Greenwheat]], longbean plants are short fibrous stalks about a foot tall. They begin to produce elongated beans in the spring, being harvested after summer has ended. The beans are picked and if not eaten within a couple of weeks will need to be preserved for long-term storage. This is typically done by boiling them in clay or glass jars that are then sealed tight to keep the beans moist and free of rot.
## Brownbean
*Climate: Warm, dry
Growing Season: Late autumn - Midspring*
Grown most commonly in [[Geography/Vurnam|Vurnam]], brownbeans require both a warmer climate and dry soil. Most places south of the [[Geography/Natural/Waterways#Reden|Reden]] are too wet for the crop to be reliably planted as they are prone to a rotting disease if they are overly saturated. The plants themselves are similar to [[Culture/Crops and Agriculture#Longbean|longbeans]], although the bean pods are typically shorter and the beans within are fatter as well as a dark brown colour. Within a few days of harvest the beans will need to be dried out in order to be preserved, either through sunbaking or smoking. Once dried, if kept dry, brownbeans can last for years in storage. They are often a staple in various forms of Vurnamese cuisine. 
## Swedeleaf
*Climate: Temperate to cool
Growing Season: Mid autumn - Early spring*
A staple crop in many places in both the southern half of the continent, as well as throughout a great deal of [[Geography/Mallerand|Mallerand]], swedeleaf consists of a bundle of dark tuberous bulbs beneath the soil that are rich in nutrients, as well as large dark green leaves that are also edible. Each plant has anywhere from five to a dozen tubers, while the leaf span tends to be 4-6 feet across. The plants themselves are quite hardy, often requiring a rockier soil than most crop plants making them ideal for places where other staples are more difficult to cultivate.
## Sunstalk
*Climate: Warm
Growing Season: Midwinter - Early summer*
Cultivated throughout the northern [[Geography/Weald/Weald|Weald]] and much of [[Geography/Vurnam|Vurnam]], sunstalk fields are an iconic sight of the region. Growing to around 6ft in height, the stalks are a fibrous dull green with small coarse leaves and 1-3 yellow flowers at the top. The petals of the flower form a spiral pattern, akin to the image of a shining sun, and are sticky with nectar. Beneath the stalk are a cluster of tubers amongst the roots that are the primary edible part of the crop, forming segmented twisted shapes that can be up to a foot long. They taste slightly sweet and nutty, and are relatively unaffected by rot or decay once harvested. The stalks are often used as livestock feed, and some places will dry and treat the stalks for more material uses as a wood substitute. Finally the flowers are often pressed, the extracted oil being used both as fuel and as a condiment.
## Leshy-Hearts
*Climate: Cool
Growing Season: Early spring - Late autumn*
A green fruit found in the pastoral regions south of the [[Geography/Natural/Waterways#Reden|Reden]] and [[Geography/Natural/Waterways#Ilma|Ilma]], it is grown as a crop as well as found naturally in lightly wooded areas. Known to the [[Beastiary/Faefolk|faefolk]] as geshygarl, it is unclear which name came first. Growing to the size of a clenched fist in a roughly teardrop shape, a leshy-heart has pale sweet flesh and a thin edible green skin. Around a dozen small brown seeds a present within each fruit, smaller than an ant they are often eaten whole with the flesh. Commonly eaten throughout the cold months of winter when the fruit keeps well, by the start of spring any leftover fruits are normally made into preserves or fermented into a cider referred to as either greenwine or leshywine.
## Roseberry
*Climate: Cool
Growing Season: Early spring - Late summer*
Grown in both [[Geography/Agercort|Agercort]] and [[Geography/Cruworia|Cruworia]], roseberry vineyards produce much of the more sought after wines of the continent. Small clusters of dusty pink berries grow on vines supported by wooden scaffolding, carefully maintained by the farmers for signs of disease or damage. The berries are collected and either turned into various preserves or sent directly for fermentation into wines. While most roseberry farms are similar, the roseberry vineyards of [[Geography/Cruworia#Hamsia|Hamsia]] cultivate a unique strain that yields a second harvest at the end of winter. This second harvest produces berries that are not pink, but are silver, and the wine produced from such berries is highly sought.
## Feathercorn
*Climate: Warm
Growing Season: Early summer - Early winter*
A staple crop throughout [[Geography/Vurnam|Vurnam]], feathercorn grows as tall grassy strands of around 3-4 ft in height that begin to expand in the autumn to produce large feathery fronds of a greyish lavender colour. These fronds are sometimes cut early to be used in that state, but typically are left until the start of winter where the fronds have begun to thicken into strings of large grains the size of a fingernail. These large grains are gathered and crushed down into flour, although they are also sometimes kept whole and roasted. The grains keep for up to a year or more if kept dry and free of pests.
## Zarfruit
*Climate: Warm, wet
Growing Season: Early spring - Early autumn*
Grown on the banks of the [[Geography/Natural/Waterways#Kulte|Kulte]], zarfruit are grown as ground-crawling thick leafy vines. Over the summer they begin to grow fruit-like bodies that can be as large as a child's head, ripening from greenish-yellow to a rich red by autumn. The outside of the zarfruit is a hard rind, but the flesh inside is soft and has a high water content. Many travellers to Vurnam balk at the taste when first trying it, finding the mixture of both sweet and spiciness to be off-putting. Zarfruit does not last more than a month after harvest, and so will need to turned to preserves, or it is also occasionally dried but this strongly intensifies the spice of the flesh.
## Qebstrand
*Climate: Temperate
Growing Season: Early spring - Late summer*
Growing along the [[Geography/Natural/Waterways#Reden|Reden]], particularly in the marshier areas, qebstrand grows as a fleshy stem up to 7ft tall and produces long purple flowers that slowly peel down the stem under their weight. As these flowers bloom and cause strips of the stem to peel away, they can be collected and dried to become stringy and fibrous, at which point it can be turned into textiles. This process can be quite involved however, being either incredibly time-consuming or requiring specialist equipment to process the stems into string.
## Spiderblossoms
*Climate: Warm, dry
Growing Season: Mid autumn - Late spring*
Stout thorny trees that grow in the drier regions of the north, spiderblossoms are often gnarled and scattered across a large area. Attempts to cultivate them are difficult as they seem to struggle to grow in close proximity to each other. Around the end of spring they produce delicate white flowers for only a couple of weeks. When harvested, these flowers can be pulped down and extruded into silky strands which can be further weaved into highly sought after textiles.
## Saltberries
*Climate: Warm, dry
Growing Season: Mid spring - Late winter*
Small bushes that grow mostly along the [[Geography/Vurnam|Vurnam]] coastline, as well as around the waters of [[Geography/Vurnam#Baisen|Baisen]], saltberries are cultivated in small fields and often take all year to mature. Growing up to 4ft tall, the bushes have small wooden trunks and silvery-green leaves. Blooming with a multitude of tiny white and black flowers spring, these slowly form into the saltberries that mature through the rest of the year. Forming from the flowers as small bunches of a half dozen or so berries, each growing up to the size of an eyeball, they are a waxy black and have a distinctive oily smell. Once harvested they are almost exclusively used pressed into an oil that fetches a high price throughout the rest of the continent. They are edible, but given their incredibly salty taste most people find them very unappetizing.
## Golders
*Climate: Temperate
Growing Season: Late spring - Midwinter*
Grown on big trees throughout the southern [[Geography/Weald/Weald|Weald]] and [[Geography/Agercort|Agercort]], golders are an orange fuzzy fruit that grow as balls a slight bit smaller than [[Culture/Crops and Agriculture#Leshy-Hearts|leshy-hearts]]. The flesh inside is golden and riddled with thin fibrous veins, with a single large seed in the centre. Its almost honey-like taste leads it to be used both in winemaking as well as in the production of all manner of deserts. Orchards are relatively common, but the fruit doesn't keep long and so needs to be preserved in various manners for it to be exported anywhere else.
