Originally found across the whole length of the [[Geography/Natural/Waterways#Reden|Reden]], over time two distinct groups of humans have arisen - the pirates along the central coastline, and the nobles of [[Geography/Agercort|Agercort]], although many humans do still live throughout the [[Geography/Weald/Weald|Weald]]. Living for up to a century in lucky cases, humans have a strong tendency to spread and a stubbornness to adapt to near any environment. Social creatures by nature, humans have a willingness to befriend about anyone and are often capable of much greater social cohesion than many of the other dominant cultures of the continent.
## Culture
Humans seem to universally have a tendency towards teamwork and companionship, often quickly building rapport with those around them and combining their strengths and skill sets to achieve things individually impossible. While many other cultures look to force, logic, or even divine judgement to adjudicate differences between them, human cultures are renowned for their ability to "agree to disagree". Their capacity for adept social navigation and diplomacy have led them to be excellent envoys, couriers, and merchants beyond their homelands. Those who live along the coast have concocted complex treaties and honour codes indecipherable to most outsiders to minimize conflict between what would otherwise be bandits and scoundrels, assembling into the feat of diplomacy that is the [[Geography/Port Manteaux#The Corsair Court|Corsair Court of Port Manteaux]]. Meanwhile in the southwest of the continent lies [[Geography/Agercort|Agercort]], a kingdom of agricultural duchies and baronies engaged in a constantly turning carousel of nobility. Many humans worship [[Mythos/The Mortal Gods/Panismé|Panismé]] or [[Mythos/The Mortal Gods/Ambrax|Ambrax]], although you can find human clergy in just about any organised religious group.
