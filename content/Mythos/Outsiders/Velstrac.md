Entities of the [[Mythos/Realms/Netherrealm|Netherrealm]], these creatures are sensitive to the psychic emanations of pain. Lacking the ability to feel anything, they are obsessed with the concept of pain and have unfortunately turned to all manner of torture and mutilation in order to satisfy their morbid curiosity. They try to lure mortals into the shadows, or abscond with them if given the chance, returning to their own plane where they go to great effort to carry out all manner of horrendous acts while ensuring their victims are kept alive. It is of note that velstrac often attempt to replicate their experiments on themselves after working on their mortal test subjects, but their inability to feel anything means understanding continues to elude them. While their dismissal of consent irrevocably marks velstrac as evil, there are some scholars who argue that these creatures don't properly understand why their acts of torture are so desperately avoided by mortals, and perhaps if it were possible to effectively convey the concept of pain to them it might be possible to persuade them to cease their experiments.
