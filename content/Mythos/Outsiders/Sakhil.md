Terrifying creatures of the [[Mythos/Realms/Netherrealm|Netherrealm]] who consume the psychic energy of mortal fear, similar to [[Beastiary/Wisps|wisps]]. Unlike the almost mindless behaviour of wisps, sakhil are well aware of the terrors they inspire, going to great lengths to manipulate mortals into creating the most fear possible. It is believed they can sense fear from the Netherrealm, following the source until their would-be victim falls asleep. From there the sakhil mentally plagues them with recurring nightmares, hoping to eventually use them as a nexus by which to manifest in the [[Mythos/Realms/Material Realm|Material Realm]].
