Violent and vile creatures native to [[Mythos/Realms/Infernum|Infernum]], daemons are manifestations of death who seek the slaughter of all life. While [[Mythos/Fiends/Devils|devils]] represent mortal sins, daemons represent the many ways in which life ends. Coming in countless shapes and sizes, it is easy to discount daemons as savage mindless monstrosities - a misconception many daemons are happy to let spread. While it is true that many lesser daemons are little more than unthinking carnage machines, many of the more powerful daemons possess great intellect and cunning. Their goal is not to kill a few dozen people, their goal is to kill *everything*, a goal they recognise will not be achieved with brute force. While many lesser daemons tend to represent literal means of death (stabbing, drowning, burned alive, etc), the more powerful the daemon the more conceptual they seem to become. Archdaemons - daemons of immense power and influence - often represent grander causes such as war, ignorance, or doubt.
