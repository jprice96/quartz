title: "Ambrax"
---
God of craft and skill, Ambrax has large temples in [Mallerand](Geography/Mallerand.md) as well as chapels throughout the continent. He is associated with learning and mastery, the application of practice and ingenuity to achieve. It is said he was the first being to tame metal with fire, turning it into tools and weapons and art far beyond what had been possible before. He is explicitly not lawful, he teaches that while one must have the discipline to learn a skill, one must also be creative, willing to experiment, and open to inspiration. He himself is not ever portrayed as evil, but he cares little whether others are good or evil, only if they have skill. His followers are often learned people themselves, alchemists, clerics, wizards, even bards or rogues - Ambrax cares not where your talents lie, just that you pursue them. He is only interested in explicit skill however, a sculptor of remarkable technique is of interest to him, a less precise sculptor with greater artistic statements not so much.

His symbol is a sword crossed over a hammer, for he was the first to make and wield such instruments. Whenever his followers focus on martial skill, they have a tendency to use unusual or exotic weapons that require greater dedication to master, even creating or modifying such weapons to further refine their own personal style.

## Architects of Ambrax
Said to be some of the greatest mortals to ever live, masters of their craft, Ambrax lifted them above and granted them the secrets of an ageless existence, needing fear only mortal injury they now serve him and continue to hone their craft. Occasionally they might be tempted to aid other mortals in achieving greatness.

### Latom, Shaper of Stones
Said to be the mind behind the [[Geography/Mallerand/Arx Saxum#Vaults of Sasellum|Vaults of Sasellum]], Latom was a master stonemason and architect who is responsible for many of the advancements in dwarven architecture and engineering, some of which has since been lost to time. There are claims that his architectural prowess was inspired by a visit to [[Mythos/The Mortal Gods/Jirem#Murmur, The Inescapable|Murmur]], although when and how he did this is unknown he never refuted the claims. While unconfirmed, he is also claimed to be a member of the Conditorem family, one of the families who maintain the Vaults to this day.

### Marcus, Hammer Dancer
A master soldier trained in all kinds of warfare, he defeated Ambrax himself in single combat by using the god's own favoured weapon of a warhammer against him thanks to advanced fighting styles he had developed himself. Never before, or since, had the creator of the hammer been defeated by his own weapon, and so to dwarven shame the greatest hammer wielder of history is a human.

### Veniceous, Keeper of the Grimoire
The witch who founded the [[Culture/List of Factions#Roun Coven|Roun Coven]], still the dominant coven of Mallerand to this day, Veniceous was a dwarven woman whose mastery of both arcane and occult lore was renowned. So great was her power that the lords of Arx Saxum feared her and were forced to keep her appeased until eventually Ambrax took her under his wing. Her grimoire is infamous, written entirely in a lost language it supposedly contains a plethora of hexes, formulae, and rituals she developed and she alone understood.

### Aculara, Metalweaver
A gnomish smith of great ingenuity, she is attributed with the invention of adamantine, along with a number of other weapons, tools, even homunculi or since unparalleled designs. Her creativity eventually drew Ambrax's attention, her constructions amused and intrigued him so much that he eventually recruited her to come and be his assistant.
