title: "Lingzul"
---
Goddess of fertility and family, Lingzul is primarily worshipped by the tribes of [Vurnam](Geography/Vurnam.md) and in many places in [Mallerand](Geography/Mallerand.md). She is also often associated with the natural order of the world, and a philosophy of arcady (the idealisation of living in harmony with nature and the savage beauty of the uncivilized world). She is largely considered to be neutral in respects to morality, although there are various interpretations of her ideals both lawful and chaotic. Her clergy are often clerics, druids, or shamans either aiming to help others live in accordance with nature or seeking to better understand how to do so themselves.

Her symbol is that of a great tree, taken both as a sign of the long-standing value and power of the natural order as well as more metaphorically as a family tree or an elder watching over those who have come after. Those who take up arms in her name often employ spears or slings, if not fighting unarmed, preferring more primitive or simplistic weapons over those of forged metals.

## The Zirbaum
The remnants of the great tree Zirbaum still stand in [[Geography/Vurnam#Gerting|Gerting]], a shadow of their former glory. It is said that Lingzul meditated under the leaves of the Zirbaum every day for a full year, and in doing so conversed with it in great detail about the world. Having taken in such wisdoms, the Zirbaum became wise itself and continued to preach the words of Lingzul after she left. For countless generations the great tree acted as a conduit between the natural world and the followers of Lingzul, advising them on how best to act in accordance with the natural order. During the winter of 286 2E the Zirbaum began to wilt. It is said to have once featured blooms of every colour, leaves of every shape, yet for reasons unknown it began to deteriorate. The druids who tended to and communed with the Zirbaum were at a loss, claiming that the tree had gone silent and what little it still said was indecipherable. The desecration of the continent by the other kingdoms had already been a great topic of debate, and many saw the fate of the Zirbaum as a proxy for the natural order of the whole continent.

Despite all attempts to aid or prolong the Zirbaum, it was completely dead by the following winter, unifying the tribes to retaliate and start the [[Culture/History/Scarlett War|Scarlett War]]. Even after the [[Culture/History/Scarlett War#The Burgundy Treatise|Burgundy Treatise]] was ratified, the Zirbaum remained dead. Some gave up hope of ever reviving the great tree, some continue to work with the land or even the tree itself in the hope of resurrecting it. Some extremists see it as a sign that either the other kingdoms still need to be stopped, or that the world has been wounded beyond repair and will never be as it once was.


## Five Beasts
While Lingzul is often considered the mortal element of nature, she frequently engages with the Five Beasts, elemental avatars of nature who acknowledge her strength but bow to no one. Each is tied to a different element and said to represent a different aspect of the natural order.

### Erang, Beast of Fire
The king of Eberarks, Erang is *the* apex predator - all other things are his prey and he will hunt whomever and whatever he wishes. He is said not to know fear and to represent the dominance the strong have over the weak.
### Skanareng, Beast of Metal
A giant grief asp, Skanareng is a heartless predator who strikes the most vulnerable without mercy. He can sense even the slightest weakness and will exploit and abuse any advantage, he is said to represent the uncaring and callous nature of the wilds.
### Vilakan, Beast of Water
The largest of the Mamlambo, Vilakan drifts the deep waters awaiting her victims. She feels no need to exert herself and her size deters most dangers, drawing her prey in with her confusing visual displays and illusions. She is said to represent the risks of untempered curiosity and hidden danger.
### Zuzanti, Beast of Earth
Matriarch of the Feathered Bears, Zuzanti slumbers with one eye open, roused only by the calls of her many children. Despite her benevolent appearance, her fury once roused is fearsome and she protects her kin fiercely, said to represent the bonds of blood and a mother's strength.
### Yemon, Beast of Wood
Alpha of the Painted Stags, Yemon is proud and distant. He and his herd are graceful and beautiful whether grazing or trampling hunters to a bloody pulp. Despite being herbivorous, he is known to have a bloodlust that once roused can be difficult to sate. He is said to represent the power of numbers and the savagery of cornered prey.
