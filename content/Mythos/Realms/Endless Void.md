## Proteans
Half-formed entities of roiling chaos, proteans are born from the primordial soup that lies beyond and between the planes of existence. Occurring through coincidence, the matter that makes up their form is only temporary - it could last seconds or it could last centuries, after which it may return back to raw chaos or it may take on a new configuration. They seem to struggle to comprehend the fundamental aspects of the physical plane, such as linear time and traversable space. For this reason, among others, it is difficult to assign purpose or motivation to any given protean, let alone all of them, yet they do seem to share a common goal to return from whence they came. This typically becomes a problem either because they cannot figure out how to, or that they insist on trying to take something or someone with them. Such beings of seemingly irrational and chaotic thoughts and forms are most often found under the influences of [[Mythos/The Mortal Gods/Zeva|Zeva]], [[Mythos/The Mortal Gods/Jirem|Jirem]], or [[Mythos/The Mortal Gods/Vorvado|Vorvado]].
