Perhaps the least understood realm by mortal mages, Limbo seems to be a realm of nothing. Counterintuitively it seems to be a realm of near infinite potential, and some mages theorise that Limbo may be the source of certain magical forces and materials otherwise unexplained. It is unclear if Limbo has native inhabitants, attempts to contact or summon such creatures have never been proven successful - however there are relatively reliable reports of creatures who cannot be traced to any other realm and who's abilities and uncanny mannerisms have lead some to argue that Limbo is their place of origin. Such entities have been collectively termed "aeons", a term which the entities themselves have used multiple times although it is unclear if they are referring to themselves or something else.
