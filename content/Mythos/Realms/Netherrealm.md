## Natives of the Netherrealm
- [[Mythos/Outsiders/Qlippoth|Qlippoth]] are ancient and alien creatures who seem to be relics of a forgotten past
- [[Mythos/Outsiders/Sakhil|Sakhil]] are dream-eaters who feed of the psychic emanations of mortals
- [[Mythos/Outsiders/Velstrac|Velstrac]] are unfeeling spirits who engage in horrific sadomasochistic experiments on mortals
## The Mockery
Most of the Netherrealm is the region referred to as the Mockery, if it is not just referred to as the Netherrealm itself. This place of shadow and smoke mirrors the [[Mythos/Realms/Material Realm|Material Realm]] in a twisted fashion shaped from the subconscious perceptions of those living there affecting the materials of the Netherrealm.
## The Precipice
Sometimes referred to more specifically as the Khobfa Precipice, the Precipice does not mirror any part of the [[Mythos/Realms/Material Realm|Material Realm]], at least not any known place. It is here that the Netherrealm seems to fall away into the [[Mythos/Realms/Endless Void|Endless Void]], one of the only places where a realm seems to actually end. Featuring twisted terrain and crumbling ruins, these floating chunks of the Netherrealm are seemingly suspended in a state of falling. Navigating between them is difficult, and it is always possible that wherever you are standing will finally fall away to be consumed by the Void. There are beings who reside here though, few and far between, only those truly desperate or insane would seek to stay here.
