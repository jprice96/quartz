Unusual creatures of uncertain history, many consider leshy to be something akin to a cross between a [[Beastiary/Golems#Poppets|poppet]] and a [[Beastiary/Nymphs|nymph]]. A body made of organic matter is built in preparation for a leshy, which then though a special ritual is bound to the leshy's spirit allowing it to possess the form as though it was a body of its own flesh and blood. The form or source of the unbound leshy spirit is unclear, with some claiming they are a kind of disembodied fey spirit, others claiming they are nymphs who have lost their physical origin. Regardless of their original source, it is known that a leshy spirit can be rebound to a new body should its old body be damaged or destroyed.

While it is possible for others to create a leshy through special rituals, most leshy are created by others of their own kind, often claiming that they do so when they "hear the call" of a disembodied spirit seeking a new body. It is also possible for a leshy to build their own next body. Once bound to a body, a leshy is free to do whatever it pleases. Many live in leshy communities, while others live amongst fey or witch communities. Wandering leshies, or leshy who live amongst mundane mortals are rarer, and a leshy is often an unusual sight to behold by common folk of the continent.

## Seaweed Leshy

These leshy are of the amphibious variety, living in lakes, rivers, lagoons, and any other shallow areas of water. They tend to be pranksters of sorts, but are rarely malevolent or violent unless strongly provoked or cornered. They often collect various 'treasures' that they find beneath the water, and it is quite common for them to bury their findings in little caches by the shore or in some deep waterlogged crevice. Unfortunately sometimes mortals come across such caches and think them for the taking - an inadvisable course of action should you intend on remaining near that body of water for the foreseeable future.
