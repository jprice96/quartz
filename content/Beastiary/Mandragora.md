Mandrake roots have a number of alchemical uses and have always been known to have a connection to blood. In the case of a mandragora, the roots have been fed the blood of a fiend leading to sudden and malignant growth. Initially the size of a gnome or halfling, the twisted plants crave blood - the blood of magical beings such as sorcerers, fey, or celestials are particularly addictive. The more blood they consume, the larger they grow. When left unchecked (or more likely when deliberately fed a steady supply of blood), they can reach monstrous proportions, with reports of some larger than a house.

They are particularly known for their piercing screech that curdles the blood of all who hear it, leaving them vulnerable to attacks. Once bitten, they release a venom which can further disable their victims. Due to their unusual spawning conditions, they are typically the result of deliberate interventions. Sorcerers who are power-hungry, or otherwise ill-informed, will occasionally keep a mandragora as a familiar, feeding it their own blood in exchange for loyalty.
