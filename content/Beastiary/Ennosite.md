Creatures of unclear origin, they seem to manifest when teleportation or summoning magics are used prolifically. From there however they can spread and linger seemingly indefinitely as they seem to lack physical flesh and the needs and restrictions that accompany it.

## Iotons

The most commonly encountered ennosite, an ioton is just a small ephemeral cluster of thought and energy. They are drawn to both magical and mental energy, seeming to consume both without preference, but the consumption of mental energy is typically of greater relevance. This process is often moderately painful for the individual being fed off, causing painful migraines as well as the loss of the consumed thoughts and feelings. The more an ioton consumes, it seems the more conscious it becomes, with reports of iotons who have been left unchecked manifesting new capabilities. Typically ioton infestations are quickly dealt with however, and their dissipation will allow the consumed memories to return to their victims.

## Loreavor

Iotons are shaped by the thoughts they feed upon. It is believed that the consumption of an excess of secrets, guilt, and deceit is what leads to the formation of a loreavor. It is said that the faces that appear on it's extended body are the faces of it's victims, their secrets silently being screamed in the hopes of freeing themselves. While it is often associated with the kind of terrible dark secrets someone would take to their grave, loreavors care not for the content of the secret, they care only for the secrecy itself. As a result they are often drawn to libraries and laboratories wherein they devour the thoughts of new discoveries or leave ancient tomes blank as they absorb the rare secret knowledge within.

## Caulborn

Once an ioton has finished taking the surface thoughts of victims, they begin to take deeper parts of the mind, eventually leaving fractured people missing decades of memories and key pieces of their personality. Having consumed enough of such thoughts, they will transform into a caulborn. Such creatures are obsessed with gorging themselves on information. At this point they can actually become quite difficult to pin down as they become more talented at feeding. No longer do they steal thoughts from others, instead they can simply read the minds of others nearby, adding to their repository of knowledge without their victims being any the wiser. As such they can become incredibly knowledgeable, although they are relatively incapable of prioritising information, a recipe for eternal life, the secret plans of a coup, and a recipe for greenbean soup are all equivalent to a caulborn, distinguished only by whether or not it is information they already have.
