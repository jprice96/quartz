A lesser form of chimera, the peryton is often found in the foothills and cliffs of [[Geography/Mallerand|Mallerand]], although lone individuals have been spotted elsewhere. Preferring rocky precipices and tall trees, they will stalk prey sometimes for days on end before striking from above. When they do, they will often go right for the heart, ripping it out of the chest. Why they do this isn't entirely clear, but it seems to be the only part of the body that is actually eaten.

Some daring individuals attempt to train perytons, they do possess sufficient intellect but they are incredibly antisocial, typically considering other creatures as either prey or competition. Rarely however a peryton will recognise another creature, be it another peryton or a trainer, as an acceptable leader. In these cases the peryton serves ceaselessly and is a vicious bloodhound, apparently able to "smell a target's shadow".
