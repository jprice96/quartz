Nymphs are the collective term for fey bound to nature. Often presenting a humanoid appearance, yet sometimes capable of other forms, they tend to appear made of their natural element. Each nymph is derived from some natural feature, such a dryads from a tree or naiads from a stream, and under normal circumstances they are physically bound to the locale of their origin. More powerful individuals may be able to travel further afield, and unusual events can sometimes sever the bond, but typically even when not nearby a nymph is spiritually connected to their origin. They can sense if their origin is threatened or damaged, and if it is in some way harmed it will often be reflected in the nymph's own form and strength. Many nymphs can teleport back to the point of their origin at will, and if their physical form is destroyed they will reform later at their origin (provided it too hasn't been destroyed).

Originating from streams, lakes, lagoons, or other permanent bodies of water, naiads tend to be more solitary than most nymphs. They are the most likely to engage openly with the mortal races, as their origins often sit side by side with settlements, and they often long for company. Na√Øve at first, the nature of a naiad tends to be formed over their first interactions. Communities that respect and accommodate the naiad will find their water clean of disease, thriving with fish, calm under boats. Those who anger or despoil the naiad and her origin will find themselves afflicted by waterborne illness, flash flooding, and frequent drownings. Unfortunately once angered, it can be very difficult to regain a naiad's trust - some settlements are abandoned over a soured relationship with one. Powerful naiads have also been described as powerful sirens, able to lure and transfix those with hypnotic undulating beauty as they slowly drown without even a struggle.
