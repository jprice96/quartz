![Boggard](Beastiary/Images/Boggard.png)
Amphibious and primitive frog-like goblinoids, boggards live in the marshes of the [[Geography/Natural/Waterways#Sullen Swamp|Sullen Swamp]] and the mangroves of the [[Geography/Natural/Waterways#Marekaj Marsh|Marekaj Marsh]]. With their own language and culture, there have been numerous anthropological expeditions to try and study and converse with the boggards, all of which have ended poorly. It is not just their propensity to attack non-boggards who approach, in the rare cases where breakthroughs in diplomacy have been made they are short lived. It seems that boggards lack anything akin to a long-term memory. They can remember people and events for a few hours, maybe a day, but they seem unable to retain anything longer than that. Their day to day life seems to be dictated more by instinct and cultural norms than having actually learned things. This has made negotiating with them fruitless, and most have given up all attempts of "domesticating" a boggard.

Of their culture, some things have been gleaned. They seem fascinated with turtles, often killing and taking their shells for adornment, yet seeming unwilling to eat the meat. This is usually fed to the other beasts who tend to live amongst them, often bloodseekers, or in larger villages crocodiles.
