Faefolk includes a variety of different fey creatures that typically live in close proximity to mortals and urban environments, rather than being tied to natural habitats like many other fey. Some live openly with those willing to share their space with faefolk, while others are more secretive or elusive.

## Zrukbat

Small bat-like creatures with a dreadful appearance, there is something about a zrukbat's visage that is deeply disturbing to most mortals who look upon them - a fact the zrukbats are keenly aware of. They are however enthralled by the mundane happenings of mortal life, cackling and gossiping over such banality as how many tunics the washerwoman cleaned today, or what colour scarfs the children in the street wore. In order to facilitate their observations, they polymorph themselves into various household objects that they may look on unnoticed. They do unfortunately lack a bit of perspective however, as their disguises while generally quite convincing in quality, are often spotted due to a failure to understand context. They may turn into an icicle hanging from a roof eave in the middle of summer, or a wooden stool standing on top of a table instead of beneath. Such things, combined with the feeling of being watched, tend to make superstitious mortals jump to the conclusion that they are being haunted.
