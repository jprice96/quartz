Uncommon, but found across the continent, hags are one of the many variants of mortals that exist beyond the typical races. Often with lifespans measured in centuries, hags are typically seen as occult masters who live in isolation, sometimes from choice and sometimes in exile. While some of the witch covens do have hag members, many hags have a strong distaste for other mortal races and will often enact all manner of wretched things upon them. While there are countless stories told of hags to scare small children, many common ideas about them are misconceptions and proper interviews and studies of hag origins and society reveal complex castes of different hags.
## Changelings
Appearing as normal children, changelings occur in across the continent. Sometimes family members or friends might feel that there is something *odd* about the changeling, but it is difficult to actually identify a changeling before adolescence. The only way to know for sure is death, which causes the changeling to change prematurely in their final moments, something that normally only happens from an accident rather than actual execution. Once they enter adolescence, changelings will demonstrate some magical aptitude not dissimilar from sorcerers or psychics. As they reach maturity however, the changeling will begin to distance themselves from their community, sensing something is different about themselves, feeling drawn elsewhere. Sometimes they are claimed by their true mothers, sometimes they are left to their own devices as they mature into a full fledged hag.
## Storm Hags

These hags despise community and family, they tend to have been ostracised while children, their adoptive parents typically kept them at arm's length, it was easy for them to leave when the change came. The power of the storm calls to them, the drenching howling storm drowns out all else and blows and batters the flimsy hovels in which families huddle in fear. They typically love to terrorise children and break apart loving families.
Storm hags can control such weather phenomena with ease, as well as being immune to any ill effects themselves. So great is their control of the storm that they can even reshape the wind to whisper or scream in their own voice.
## Winter Hags

These hags tended to be eerily calm or emotionless as children, and found the intense emotions of those around them either fascinating, abhorrent, or both. As subtle as the turn of the seasons, a winter hags machinations can go unnoticed until suddenly you realise you have already succumbed to the cold. They are known for their tendencies to turn others against each other, to stir up old rivalries, or fabricate new ones. It is only once the intense fires of anger and rage evaporate, as suddenly as they seemed to come on, that victims come to the blood chilling realisation of what terrible things they have done. Just as the hag intended.
Winter hags are immune to the cold elements of winter, and are often ice cold to the touch. This is often one of the few ways to tell their true nature, as they are often disguised as an old or sick woman either just passing through or living on the fringe of town.
