While there are many various kinds of undeath, from vampires, to liches, to ghosts, many of the more common undead that arise are the various states in which corpses have become reanimate (either through necromancy or lack of consecration). Most of the time these walking dead are mindless, with a tendency toward violently attacking the living who encounter them. Depending on the state of their corpse, the circumstances of the death, and even the talents of the person in life, the ways in which they reanimate can vary.

## Wights

Those who die violent deaths, or who are exposed to the presence of strong void energies either at their time of death or afterwards, can reanimate as wights. Some amount of void energy suffuses the flesh of a wight, sustaining and even preserving it in undeath. Furthermore, through vicious elongated claws grown from their hands the wight is able to spread its void energy - draining the energies from the living and, if fatally injuring them, causing the victim to rise as a wight also. In this way a single unfettered wight can turn half a village overnight, resulting in a full blown plague of undeath. Not entirely mindless, a wight often carries out similar patterns to what they did in life - labourers and miners will brawl and grapple the living, while hunters or scoundrels will lurk in shadows and pounce on their victims.

## Skeleton

Common, but oft misunderstood, skeletons are among the first of the walking dead to rise from the fallen, and the first to be mastered by necromancers. This is because, unlike most walking dead, they are not the sick and twisted souls of the dead hooked back into their corpses. Instead skeletons are a chimera, a collection of soul fragments, bound to bone and stitched into a barely cohesive collective. Some argue they are more akin to a complex swarm or hive mind than an individual creature. As a result, many skeletons are in possession of unnatural powers not necessarily derived from their body's original capabilities. Peasants can be reanimated as sorcerers, bulls as flaming beasts, or amalgamations of a dozen original bodies merged into a shapeshifting bonestorm. They can also be difficult to deal with, resistant to most kinds of damage due to their lack of flesh or real connection to their body, and once their bones are broken apart it is often best to scatter them lest they pull themselves back together.


## Mohrg

Those who harboured terrible secrets in life can return in death as a mohrg, their outer flesh and skin peeling away to reveal their bones and internal organs. Their wretched selves revealed upon the world, they grow and elongated and barbed tongue which becomes a vicious weapon. To lay eyes upon a mohrg's form is to incur its wrath, enraged and humiliated that you have seen it, it will hunt you down relentlessly. Their tongue is deceptively dangerous, fast, long, and coated with a neurotoxin that paralyzes victims. Those killed by a morhg are quickly stripped of their flesh in turn, reanimated as a new mohrg under the original's control, forcing it to commit their own shameful atrocities. If you can find the original mohrg amongst them, killing it will release all those it has corrupted beneath it.
