![Rusalksa](Beastiary/Images/Rusalka.png)
An aquatic fey, rusalka are feared by sailors and shore-dwellers alike. Found along the coast as well as the eastern stretches of the [[Geography/Natural/Waterways#Reden|Reden]] and [[Geography/Natural/Waterways#Kulte|Kulte]] rivers, they tend to live just beyond the edges of civilization - close enough that they can come across mortal victims, but far enough that their lairs are unlikely to be disturbed. In [[Geography/Vurnam|Vurnam]] it is commonly believed that rusalka are the children of [[Mythos/The Mortal Gods/Lingzul#Vilakan, Beast of Water|Vilakan]], while further south it is more commonly believed that they are the favoured (or spurned) of [[Mythos/The Mortal Gods/Panism√©#Grivois, Muse of Pleasure|Grivois]].
